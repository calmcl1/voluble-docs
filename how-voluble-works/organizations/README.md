# Organizations

An `Organization` represents any company or real-world organization that needs to be able to send messages to its' employees, members, or customer base.

Each `Organization` can have several [`Users`](../users.md) and [`Contacts`](../contacts.md), who can send and receive [`Messages`](../messages.md) respectively. Every `Organization` has access to all of the [`Services`](../services-and-servicechains.md) that are installed on the Voluble instance, but it's [`Servicechains`](../services-and-servicechains.md) are kept private.
