# Voluble

Voluble is a messaging system designed for organizations who need to communicate with several people at a time and keep track of who's replied. This can range from small sports clubs getting a message to all their members, to large broadcasters keeping multiple crews informed about what's happening.

An Organization can have as little as a single user, or as many as they need - there's no built-in limit.
